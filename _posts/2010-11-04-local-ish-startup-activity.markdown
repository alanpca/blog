<p>It seems that the Windsor&#47;Metro Detroit area is finally getting some startup assistance love.</p>
<p>No great incubator yet, but we do﻿ have a few upcoming events in the area:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.startupdrinks.ca&#47;index.php&#47;windsor&#47;">Windsor Startup Drinks<&#47;a> wi﻿ll be taking place next week, November 10th, in downtown Windsor. &nbsp;It seems to be hosted by the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.softechalliance.ca&#47;">Softech Alliance<&#47;a> and <a href="http:&#47;&#47;sifewindsor.com&#47;">SIFE Windsor<&#47;a>.<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;detroit.startupweekend.org&#47;">Detroit Startup Weekend<&#47;a> will be held at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;techtownwsu.org&#47;">TechTown<&#47;a> at my alma mater, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wayne.edu">Wayne State University<&#47;a>, next weekend (November 12th-14th, 2010).<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
This is a great chance for local startup-minded people to network and, as I like to say, increase their geek circle. &nbsp;If you are one of these people, get out there and get involved.</p>
