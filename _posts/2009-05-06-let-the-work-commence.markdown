<p>I have officially started my work today for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thousandparsec.net">Thousand Parsec<&#47;a>.&nbsp; My GSoC mentor, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mavrinac.com&#47;">Aaron Mavrinac<&#47;a>, has outlined these items for me to complete in the next week or so:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Make a test commit to tpserver-cpp mtsec branch (add yourself to AUTHORS).</p>
<p>2. Read the TP protocol spec again, make sure you understand what each<br />
thing is.</p>
<p>3. Read Part III of the ruleset development manual.</p>
<p>4. Write me a report about what exactly MTSec currently does in the<br />
code - summary of what the standard hooks are doing, list of orders,<br />
list of objects, etc.<&#47;blockquote><br />
I've completed task #1 and I am beginning the rest of the tasks.&nbsp; My plan is to read the spec over again (I read it many times during the proposal stage) and complete these tasks by the end of the weekend.</p>
