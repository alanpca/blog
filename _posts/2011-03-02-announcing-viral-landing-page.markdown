    Hi,
    I have read through githib about this source code. But I am not a ruby programmer. Can you give me some assistant to use thsi code as my landing page. I reviewed launchrock and that looks great. I do appreciate your assistance! GREAT DAY! :)

<p>I have been working on a few projects which require a landing page over the past couple of months, and this has come to the forefront of my thoughts more recently. As a Startup Weekend alumnus, I was pretty excited to see that <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.launchrock.com">launchrock<&#47;a> was fully launched and gaining quite a bit of traction. One problem, though, is that I would have to sign up for each project and then promote the links. I don't like to post too many links on my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;twitter.com&#47;alanpca">Twitter<&#47;a> and&#47;or Facebook accounts, so I decided against this. If you're not familiar with the concept, here is an excerpt from the description on the Github repo:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>When a user submits their e-mail address, it will immediately be recorded to the<br />
local database. The user will then be shown "sharing" icons from Facebook and<br />
Twitter. Each successful click or referral will be recorded to the database for<br />
that user. This makes it easier for you to allow earlier access to people who are<br />
driving traffic to your site.<br />
<&#47;pre><br />
<&#47;blockquote><br />
The next route was to implement something similar, which I did over the past couple of days. The result is <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;alanpca&#47;viral-landing-page">viral-landing-page<&#47;a> (very original name, I know), which can be found in my <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;alanpca">Github repositories<&#47;a> immediately. Viral-landing-page was written in Ruby on Rail because, well, I love the framework. For Javascript, I chose jQuery for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Viral-landing-page far from polished, but it should be good enough to begin using immediately. I chose to license it under the <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;alanpca&#47;viral-landing-page&#47;blob&#47;master&#47;LICENSE">BSD open source license<&#47;a>, which is quite permissive. While it isn't required, I'd like to know who is using this software (and early access to your startup =D). You can comment on this blog post, or contact me via any other methods. I will be actively adding features (maybe an admin viewer) as I use the project more and more for my own needs. Feel free to fork and push back any changes!</p>
