I have officially started my work today for [Thousand Parsec](http://www.thousandparsec.net). My GSoC mentor, [Aaron Mavrinac](http://mavrinac.com/), has outlined these items for me to complete in the next week or so:

1. Make a test commit to tpserver-cpp mtsec branch (add yourself to AUTHORS).
2. Read the TP protocol spec again, make sure you understand what each thing is.
3. Read Part III of the ruleset development manual. 
4. Write me a report about what exactly MTSec currently does in the code - summary of what the standard hooks are doing, list of orders, list of objects, etc.

I've completed task #1 and I am beginning the rest of the tasks. My plan is to read the spec over again (I read it many times during the proposal stage) and complete these tasks by the end of the weekend.
