I have been formally accepted into Google's Summer of Code (GSoC) for 2009. I will be working on the [Thousand Parsec](http://www.thousandparsec.net) open source project.&nbsp; The Thousand Parsec project is a group of 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) games built around a common framework.

My proposal is to complete the now-primitive Missile and Torpedo Ruleset (MTSec). From my abstract:

> In this Google Summer of Code project, I plan to complete the MTSec ruleset, ultimately delivering a working and enjoyable ruleset to tpserver-cpp. This second milestone game is meant to be a fun game and to exercise the object design capabilities of the Thousand Parsec framework.
> 

 Essentially, I plan on implementing a playable version of the MTSec ruleset by the end of the GSoC period. Throughout this process I will be posting updates on this blog, marked as category GSoC.
