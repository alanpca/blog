It seems that the Windsor/Metro Detroit area is finally getting some startup assistance love.

No great incubator yet, but we do﻿ have a few upcoming events in the area:

*   [Windsor Startup Drinks](http://www.startupdrinks.ca/index.php/windsor/) wi﻿ll be taking place next week, November 10th, in downtown Windsor. It seems to be hosted by the [Softech Alliance](http://www.softechalliance.ca/) and [SIFE Windsor](http://sifewindsor.com/).
*   [Detroit Startup Weekend](http://detroit.startupweekend.org/) will be held at [TechTown](http://techtownwsu.org/) at my alma mater, [Wayne State University](http://www.wayne.edu), next weekend (November 12th-14th, 2010).

This is a great chance for local startup-minded people to network and, as I like to say, increase their geek circle. If you are one of these people, get out there and get involved.
