<p>I have been formally accepted into Google's Summer of Code (GSoC) for 2009.&nbsp; I will be working on the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thousandparsec.net" target="_blank">Thousand Parsec<&#47;a> open source project.&nbsp; The Thousand Parsec project is a group of 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate) games built around a common framework.</p>
<p>My proposal is to complete the now-primitive Missile and Torpedo Ruleset (MTSec).&nbsp; From my abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this Google Summer of Code project, I plan to complete the MTSec ruleset, ultimately delivering a working and enjoyable ruleset to tpserver-cpp. This second milestone game is meant to be a fun game and to exercise the object design capabilities of the Thousand Parsec framework.<&#47;blockquote><br />
Essentially, I plan on implementing a playable version of the MTSec ruleset by the end of the GSoC period.&nbsp; Throughout this process I will be posting updates on this blog, marked as category GSoC.</p>
