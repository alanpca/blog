<p>There have been various discussions in both the GSoC mailing list and official IRC channel regarding improving your chances of getting into GSoC.&nbsp; Since the 2009 process has already finished, I have these suggestions for 2010 students and beyond:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be active in the community.<&#47;li>
<li>Write a good proposal, submit it early.<&#47;li>
<li>Subscribe to your update notifications for your proposal.<&#47;li>
<li>Update your proposal.<&#47;li>
<li>Be active in the community.<&#47;li>
<li>Submit Patches.<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
Let's break these criteria down further:<br />
<a id="more"></a><a id="more-17"></a><br />
1) Be active in the community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Originally I had "Write a good proposal" first, but I decided to change it in favor of community involvement.&nbsp; This is the single most important aspect of getting into Summer of Code.&nbsp; I would recommend &#47;join-ing the IRC channel and subscribing to the mailing lists of all of the projects that you are interested in working on.&nbsp; Forming an early bond with the community is something that will set you ahead in the competition with your peers.&nbsp; It is also important to note that these mentors will sometimes drop hints on which proposals are more important -- and thus more likely to be accepted.<&#47;p></p>
<p>2) Write a good proposal, submit it early.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your proposal is used to spread your idea throughout the entire project that you are applying to.&nbsp; All of the mentors and administrators of the organization will be reviewing your application and giving it a score based on how well you have done and how viable your project is.&nbsp; Each organization will require different criteria for your proposal, but it is always a good idea to include the following:<&#47;p></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li>Summary<&#47;li>
<li>What I Plan To Do<&#47;li>
<li>Why This is Important<&#47;li>
<li>Time line - Detailed<&#47;li>
<li>Deliverable<&#47;li>
<li>Maintenance<&#47;li>
<li>Availability<&#47;li>
<li>Contingency Plan<&#47;li>
<li>Myself<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you cover all of these sections thoroughly, as well as the sections required by your mentoring organization, you should do fine.<&#47;p></p>
<p>3) Subscribe to your update notifications for your proposal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We can keep this one short and sweet -- subscribe to notifications!&nbsp; Every time a mentor&#47;admin posts a public comment on your proposal, you will receive an e-mail informing you of this.&nbsp; This is not a default option, and if you don't do this you will be left guessing.<&#47;p></p>
<p>4) Update your proposal.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Throughout the application process you will be asked -- and required -- to update your proposal.&nbsp; Your mentoring organization will require you to add more information to your proposal and clarify some aspects of your proposal.&nbsp; If you do this, you are in good shape.<&#47;p></p>
<p>5) Be active in the community.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'm listing this twice because it is one of the most important things you can do during the application process.&nbsp; You should have already picked a project that you have interest in, so go ahead and make your interest known.<&#47;p></p>
<p>6) Submit Patches.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Some projects require you to submit patches to be considered for acceptance, others do not.&nbsp; Regardless, you should be submitting patches to your mentoring organization before the application deadline.&nbsp; These patches show the mentors and administrators that you have the skills required to complete your proposal.&nbsp; Your mentoring organization is looking for the "skills to pay the bills"<&#47;p></p>
<p>Doing all of these things will highly increase the probability that you are accepted by the mentoring organization that you apply to.&nbsp; Also, remember that you can submit multiple proposals.&nbsp; You want to be sure to keep your options open in case one of the organizations that you apply to does not accept your proposal.</p>
<p>I will post my <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.thousandparsec.net">Thousand Parsec<&#47;a> application in a later blog post for review.&nbsp; I hope to provide updates on how I could have improved my application as the GSoC period goes on and I learn more about it myself.</p>
